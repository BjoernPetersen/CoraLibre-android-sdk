CoraLibre-android-sdk
======================

This code is based on the [DP-3T prestandard android-sdk code](https://github.com/DP-3T/dp3t-sdk-android/tree/prestandard).
It aims to be compatible with the Apple/Google developed [Privacy-Preserving Contact Tracing](https://www.apple.com/covid19/contacttracing/) (PPCP) protocoll.
So far it is behaving more like DP-3T but we aim to transform it to be PPCP compatible.

## Todo

This repository is based on prestandard DP-3T. With this project we have the aim to create a [Privacy-Preserving Contact Tracing](https://www.apple.com/covid19/contacttracing/) compatible sdk in order to create a libre alternative to the part of the GMS services that conducts the bluetooth tracing.

The discussion about tasks that need to be done can be found in [this](https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-app-android/issues/75) thread.
This sdk should become part of the CoraLibre app which should become compatible with the german [Corona-Warn-App](https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-app-android).
