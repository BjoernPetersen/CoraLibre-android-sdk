CoraLibre-android-sdk
======================

This code is based on the [DP-3T prestandard android-sdk code](https://github.com/DP-3T/dp3t-sdk-android/tree/prestandard).
It aims to be compatible with the Apple/Google developed [Privacy-Preserving Contact Tracing](https://www.apple.com/covid19/contacttracing/) (PPCP) protocoll.
So far it is behaving more like DP-3T but we aim to transform it to be PPCP compatible.
